# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Findings
#### Successes
Among the 912 theather campaigns in the United States, 525 were successful, which is a little over half of them at 57.56%
In Great Britain, theather campaigns seems even more successful with 259 successful campaigns out of 359. That is 72.14% of success rate for taht category.
### Popular Categories in the US and Great Britain
Out of the nine categories film & video, food, games, journalism, music, photography, technology, and theather, "theather" seems to be the most popular in both countries. In the U.S. 912 campaign were started (roughly 30% of campaigns), while in G.B. 359 were started, which is more than half of all the 604 Kickstarter campaigns.
### Popular Subcategories in teh US and Great Britain
Within the theather category, "plays" are the most popular subcategories and also the most successful. In both countries there were a total of 985 campaigns and 650 of them were successful. 
### Timing 
> The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesn't seem like a great time to launch a campaign.
### Central Tendancy
Based on the data statistics, we can determine the following:
> * Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns
> * The mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money.
> * If the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects. 
### Measures of Spread
Based on the data statistics, we can determine the following:
> * The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.
> * The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center
> * Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!

**Box Plots**: Based on the data represented in this chart, we can see that > the mean campaign goal is around £4,000 in Great Britain. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.

## Recommendations
In order to ensure a successful campaign for *Fever*, Louise should aim to start her crowndfunding in May. Another thing to consider is to reduce the goal for the campaign from $10,000 to around $5,000. What Louise is currently asking for is more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, and the data shows that successful Kick starter campaigns, especially in the U.S., typically request around $5,049. Therefore, reducing her goal for the campaign would be statistically more beneficial.

If Louise is looking at a campaign in Great Britain, a campaign centered around theather is indeed the correct choice since it is one of the most popular categories there, but it also means that competition to be successful in raising the requested funds is higher. She would also need to reduce her campaign goals considerably to increase her chances of success.
Outside of theather category being popular, plays are also very popular in both the US and Great Britain, which should ensure a higher chance of success for her crowdunding campaign.
